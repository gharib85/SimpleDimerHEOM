# SimpleDimerHEOM
This is a simple HEOM code for a dimer (no Matsubara frequencies)

The code is based on the paper of Ishizaki in J. Chem. Phys. 130 234111 (2009)
It create the a superoperator for the full hierachy, find the matrix exponent and
use that to propagate the density matrix in Liouville space.
